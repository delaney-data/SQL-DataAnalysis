## The Problem [ The Digital Divide ]
As the technology in the world continues to advance and more services are exclusively accessed via the Internet, the impact of the Digital Divide (a gap between those who have access to digital technology and those who do not) can be felt harder to those on the receiving end.

The Digital Divide issue is complex and is a culmination of: 
- Lack of Technology
- Lack of Internet Access
- Lack of Digital Literacy

The coronavirus crisis has shown that not being digitally connected, or not having internet access, can result in negative consequences that range from: 
- Lack of job opportunities & employment :technologist:
    - Remote or Hybrid work
    - Applying to Jobs
    - Lack of Job-ready Skills (navigating the internet, programs, etc)
- Lack of educational resources :books:
    - Online Schooling
    - Online Education resources
- Restricted from internet-only services :no_entry:
    - Paying Bills Online
    - Paperless Documentation
    - Ordering Services (Food, Supplies, etc)
    - Smart Devices that require internet to fully function
 
 I will be analyzing data focusing specifically on the <b>Lack of Internet</b>.
